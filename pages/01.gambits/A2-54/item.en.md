Wear a necklace with a clasp, but don’t hide the clasp behind your neck. Instead, prominently show the clasp on your chest. It will annoy people, and whomever fixes it is likely showing you an IOI (Indicator of Interest) by doing this. By the end of your night, some woman who wasn’t uncomfortable getting close to you will have fixed your necklace. It gives her a reason to get close to you.
