> Was having lunch at The W Hotel. Asked for the check. Waiter says it's been taken care of. Looking around the place and there's only a couple of people, a couple of guys having a business lunch, a family in a booth, and this one guy at the bar. This hasn't really happened before so I figure I need to go say something to this guy. I go over and I say "Look, I'm really flattered, but I'm not... You know... Interested.”

> And he looks up at me and he says with the straightest face "I have no idea what you're talking about."
