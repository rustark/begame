> Hey do you like Horses?

> I knew this girl in 6th grade and she use to love horses. She had pictures of horses on her folder, her backpack and even a lunch box with horses. During lunch she would gallop around the playground making funny horse noises. You look just like her.

> I can’t tell if you’re really her, but just in case you’re her and don’t want to admit it I just wanted to tell you sorry. I used to be the cool kid and the bully. I used to make fun of the weird horse girl.

> I’m so sorry about all the times I made fun of you.
