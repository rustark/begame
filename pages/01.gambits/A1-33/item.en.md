> Hey what’s your name?

Girl:
> Bethany

> Oh really? No way. I used to have a cat named Bethany. She was a great cat, but she would shed all over the place. You don’t shed do you?

_Touch the girl’s hair a bit_

> Bethany used to shed all over my bed and I would kick her off and say, “Bethany! Get off the bed!”

> If you promise you don’t shed, I might let you into my house. I might even let you sit on my bed, but you have to bring your own lint brush, just in case.
