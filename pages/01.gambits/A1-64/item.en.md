> Why is it that women like poofy dresses? I'm accompanying a girlfriend of mine to this gala event next week... And she's all gung-ho about getting this extravagant poofy sleeved dress. Now I will take any excuse I can get to dress up... But I just don't find big frilly dresses attractive like… AT ALL. So I asked my social circle about this and they said... IN UNISON... 

_Deliver this like a high-maintenance girl_

> “Prophet, poofy ... is awesome.” And I'm like "Ok... Why?" and they say "Poofy is just awesome. Fact!” So here I am... Seeking answers from strange-looking people. Poofy is apparently awesome. But why?
