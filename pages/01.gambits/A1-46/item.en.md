PUA: Do you have a lighter?  
[Take the lighter and light your cigarette. Then casually pocket the lighter.]  
WOMAN: May I have my lighter back?  
PUA: Sure.  
[Pull out 5 lighters.]  
PUA: Which one is it?

Mystery’s note: Carry a lighter in public gatherings, even if you don’t smoke. Some attractive women DO smoke. If you don't have a lighter, the woman will ask another guy and engage HIM in conversation instead. Consider putting a cigarette behind your ear too. That way, you make it easy for a woman to ask you for a light. Where there’s a cigarette, there is very likely a lighter.
