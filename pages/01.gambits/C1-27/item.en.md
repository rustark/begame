This is a role play, where you pretend you are the male lion, and the female lions have to bring you food. In Africa, male lions don’t hunt
much, the females do the hunting and bring the food to the males. That’s what this role play is based on. Here are a few examples:

> You’re my sexy alpha lioness, will you please bring me that tasty elk over there? 
_Point to food, a beer, or the TV remote._

If there's more then one girl:

> If you guys were my lionesses, who would bring back the most food?


If I’m eating, I’ll take the steak out of my burrito and eat it with my hands, all sexy and lion-like. “RAWRRR!” Then I'll say:
> Babe, that was a nice kill, Want some?

_Sometimes you can feed her._ 

There's something attractive about this... I can sense it but it goes against everything you might think would work. Now just get even sexier and role play more, be creative.
