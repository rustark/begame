Walk up to a girl and put your hand out like you're going to shake her hand. When she puts out her hand, start thumb wresting her. Don't say a word. After you beat her, give the little "so-so" hand gesture.

**Contingencies**
> I haven’t lost a match since the third grade. Well it wasn’t really fair. I used to be on the thumbwrestling Olympic Team. I just didn’t want to tell you cause it would sound like I was bragging.

> I used to be on TV all the time for thumbwrestling. I was on ESPN 8, The Ocho.
