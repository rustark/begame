> Hey guys... Would you date someone that's still friends with his ex-girlfriend?

GROUP: <Responds.>

> Ok... Actually this is a two part question... My friend David has been dating this girl for a couple months, but he's still friends with his girlfriend from college. What do you guys think about that?

GROUP: How close are they? (Etc.)

> Well he still talks to her on the phone, and he's still got this shoebox with letters... Pictures... What do you guys think about that?

GROUP: <Responds.>

> Well get this, she told him that he needs to stop talking to the girl, and he needs to BURN THE BOX. Would you burn your box if your partner demanded it?

GROUP: <Responds.>

### Alternative:

> Hey guys... Okay, see <wing> over there. Well, he has been dating a girl for three months. And she just moved in with him. Okay. So, imagine you've been dating someone for three months. And he is still friends with his old girlfriend from college. How do you feel about that?

WOMEN: <Answer/ Are they just friends?>

> Yes, they're just friends. There's nothing else going on. They talk like once a week at most.

WOMEN: I think it's fine/ I don't think they should be talking/ Whatever

> {NEG} Okay, now let's say he has a drawer in his apartment. And in that drawer he keeps all his old photographs and letters. Now, some of those letters happen to be from exes and some of the photographs happen to be with exes.

WOMEN: <Concerned comment>

> It's not like he ever looks at them. They are just there, like old souvenirs and memories of his past.

WOMEN: <I think it's fine/ I think he should put them away in a closet/ He should destroy them/ Whatever>

> Okay, the reason I'm asking is because <wing>'s girlfriend says she doesn't want him to talk to his ex from college at all. She wants him to cut it off completely. And she wants him to destroy all his old photos and letters from exes. She says it's just holding onto the past, and he should let go of it now. Personally, I thought it was extreme and a bit insecure. But what do I know. I'm a guy. And, as we all know, guys think differently from girls â€¦
