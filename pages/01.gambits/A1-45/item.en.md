> Have you ever seen the app Google Earth? A friend sent me a Google Earth location link by email... And I clicked on it... And the entire Earth loaded up on the screen... And it zoomed into THIS VERY SPOT. I did a virtual 3D animated fly-over, and then, when I got here, even though I’ve never been here before, I got a strange sense of déjà-vu. The only difference is... The graphics are so much better in person.
