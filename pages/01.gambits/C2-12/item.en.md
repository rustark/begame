I really like this one, I set it up as a fun role play. It does a great role reversal that she has to win you over. I do this mostly on meeting up for a day 2.

> Have you seen the show the Bachelor?

> So check this out, were going to have fun tonight, I am the Bachelor and you have to win me over. If you do, you will get a rose by the end of the night.

You can also play along throughout the night, if she is being good tell her that she might get the rose. If she is being bad tell her that she wonâ€™t get the rose. If you kiss her and it is good, tease her that you think you might give her the rose.
