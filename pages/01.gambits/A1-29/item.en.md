> Hey did I ever tell you about my perfect date?

> Well, for starters, I take the girl out to lunch at a five star restaurant. Then, when we are done there, I take her shoe shopping at the best shoe stores in Beverly Hills. Then we go back to my place and we have gentle sex by the fireplace.

> And then... a beating.

> I like to beat my date, so she knows I care about her. Someone has to really matter a lot if you're willing to go through the trouble to give them a beating.

> I used to just do the restaurant and the beating, but the girl would never come back for a second date. That's why I added the shoe shopping. Now they always come back. What do you think? Would you take a beating in order to get some high end shoes?

> And the sex is SUPER GENTLE. I mean just the head. No rough stuff.

> You seem like a really sweet girl. I'd love to take you out to a 5 star restaurant sometime and if it goes will maybe give you a beating.
