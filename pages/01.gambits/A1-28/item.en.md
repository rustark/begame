> Hey im really sorry, my car broke down but i’m glad your still here.  
> How long have you been waiting?

Girl: 
> What?

> Wait... Are you bubbles6969 from match.com?

Girl:
> NO

> I so thought you were my internet date... Wow I’m like so embarrassed now.

Girl:
> Are you joking

> Do you think I’m joking? Okay you caught me, I really was joking. I would never go on a date with a girl named bubbles6969.

> You probably have a way cooler screen name than that. I bet yours is something like Bambi8000, or maybe Britney Sneers.
