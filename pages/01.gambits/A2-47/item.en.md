The PUA lights his cigarette.

PUA: You’ve seen smoke circles before, yes?  
WOMAN: Sure, I guess.  
PUA: Well have you ever seen... a smoke square?  
WOMAN: No I haven’t.  
PUA: This... Is a smoke square.  
The PUA takes a large drag from his cigarette, and proceeds to blow 4 long lines, forming a square, a foot across. He then smiles.  
PUA: I know; miracle!

Mystery’s note: Use a vape. It’s just as funny.
