> What's more important, to be wanted or to be needed?

_They answer_

> Here's my take, it's better to be wanted, because neediness is unattractive. More important question... What's more important, attraction or desire?

_They answer_

> I agree _or disagree if they don't say attraction, but they usually do_, see you look around a room like this _put your arm around her_... And you can see people you are attracted to... Well... Actually maybe not this room _roll off_.
