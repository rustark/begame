> Hey, have you ever played 5 Questions?

**WOMAN:** No/ What's that?

> Okay, the rules are simple: I ask you five questions, and all you have to do is answer them WRONG. Got it? Okay, first question, uh... [think for a moment] What street are we on?

**WOMAN:** <Responds.>

> Okay [think for a moment], what building are we in?

**WOMAN:** <Responds.>

> Okay [think for a moment], what did you have for breakfast this morning?

**WOMAN:** <Responds.>

> Okay, [think REALLY hard for moment or two], uh … [looks confused] shit, how many was that?

Now, one of two things will happen here: she will either answer you correctly (three), which means she loses, or she will be clever and purposely answer it wrong.

**WOMAN:** Three.

> OH! Got ya!

**WOMAN:** What?

> You have to answer the question WRONG silly! [Laugh a little, then stack forward]

### OR...

**WOMAN:** Um… Seven.

> Ah shit [look defeated]. Have you played this before?

**WOMAN:** Haha yay! No I've never played it!

> OHH! Got ya with the fifth one! Five questions!
