> Guys... Running off to Vegas to get married on a whim. Is that spontaneous and romantic or just plain weird?

_They answer_

> My friend Erik went to Vegas with his girlfriend and when they got back, they were married, wedding rings and everything. We all thought it was an April Fool's joke, but it's real. Now, here is the scary part: They have known each other for 3 weeks, maybe 4.

_At this point, they all want to offer their opinion, then continue._

> Ok, this may sound evil but we all have a huge pool on how long this will ast. I guessed 7 months. You want in? He said it was love at first sight. Do you guys believe in at love at first sight? I just can’t see it. I mean I believe in lust at first sight. To me lust at first sight, and love are different. I mean, you have felt lust at first sight before, right? See, the feelings are different. If you could stop... And remember a time when you felt lust at first sight. And you are looking at the guy in front of you _self point_, and you just know that you want him. Like perhaps you can feel the excitement run through your body. You might even feel like you want him to just reach out and grab you and kiss you. To take you. So much so that you might realize that your lips are dry. 

_Watch them wet their lips. They might laugh at each other as they do this. They also might not wet their lips._

> So as you are feeling it now, I want you to remember the feeling. Now ... forget that, and remember a time when you were completely in love. Like you are lying on the pillow looking deeply into the eyes of the man in your life _self point_, and you are completely comfortable and warm inside, and know deep on the inside that you are in love and he loves you. His eyes are as big as saucers, and you know yours are too. _Watch their pupils dilate._ You got that feeling? Now that is a different feeling, no? OK, so let's try to combine them. Remember what lust at first sight was like _kino by touching her_, now as you are feeling that, let’s see if you can feel love too _touch her again_. Can you combine the two?

> See that is what I think. My mate says he felt love at first sight, and I have tried in my mind to imagine what that is like, but I can’t get there. I really hope it works out for my mate. I am nervous for him. How long do you think it'll last?

_Back to jokey comedy material._

> This is like watching The View. You guys are like little detectives. You guys are like crime fighters!
