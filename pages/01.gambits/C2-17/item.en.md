_While she's talking or responding to your opener_

> Interesting... Are you a visual person?

_She responds._

> Do you think in pictures and see little movies in your head? You tend to look up when you think. People who are creative and are visually oriented tend to look up when they think. Iâ€™m the same way.

_She responds._

> We all favor different directions. People who tend to be logical, like lawyers and accountants, tend to look to the side when they think.

_Demonstrate by looking to the side._

> People who live in their emotions, touchy feely types, tend to look down.

_Demonstrate by looking down._

> We use all of them at different times, depending on what we are experiencing, but you can tell a lot about how someone thinks by which direction they favor the most. We both favor visual orientation.
