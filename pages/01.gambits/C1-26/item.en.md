> Imagine that you're at your house. At the same time, 5 things happen.

1. Your door bell rings and someone is at the door
2. Your baby is crying in the other room
3. Your clothes are outside drying and it starts raining
4. Your phone rings
5. There is a water leak in the house and the carpet is getting wet

Take the following tasks and ask the girl which she would do first and what order she would go for the rest.

1. Check on the baby
2. Answer the door
3. Answer the phone
4. Check the water leak
5. Grab the clothes from the dryer outside.

Hereâ€™s how to analyze the results. The baby crying symbolizes your family is most important to you.  
The doorbell ringing symbolizes that you friends are important to you.  
The phone ringing symbolizes the importance of your love life.   
Checking the water leak symbolizes the importance of money.  
The clothes from the outside symbolize the importance of your image and how people see you.  
Then you can sort out for her what is #1 to #5 based on how she answered.
