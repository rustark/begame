> You’re very little. When I was a teenager, my mother used to point out tall women to me and say _in a German accent_ Look, Erich, she’d be perfect for you. _End accent_ And I used to think to myself... Ew gross... Mom! 

> My first girlfriend was 5ft1 and a half. I have to say and a half to please my mother. She once said, and this was in front of my girlfriend at the time <In a female accent> You know, tall women are going without a man because of you. Mom, I can only date one woman at a time… Ok maybe two girls, but you don’t tell that to your mother, now do you?!
