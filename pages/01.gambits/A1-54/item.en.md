> How many nines exist between 1 and 100? I'll give you a hint, it's more than three.

_Neg if necessary with “I know it's mathematics and quite difficult, it's called counting.”_

> It's actually Twenty. Let’s count: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98… and 99 has two of them. That's like 20 percent. One in five is the number nine. Isn't that beautiful? It’s built into the Universe.

**Mystery’s note:** It’s not actually 20%. It’s fun to see if the person gets it. This is a great indirect opener for mixed sets.
