Any time the chick smiles, you can run this routine. It's best used once you've established that you are cool, and that you are quite attractive to her. 

> Hey... you know... you have three smiles.

Usually, she'll smile in response to this 

> And there's a fourth!

She'll probably ask something, and then you improvise along the lines of the following:

> Yeah, that was your 'I'm flattered' smile, and then you have a... um, not fake... but a polite smile... then there's this really genuine smile when you laugh, and your whole face lights up. Then there's this smug, 'hey this guy fancies me' smile. I've a feeling I might see that a lot.
