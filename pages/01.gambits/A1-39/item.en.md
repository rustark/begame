The PUA says nothing. He pulls out a notepad and a pencil. He proceeds to draw on it as he looks at a particular person. He periodically puts his thumb up and looks at the person, squinting through one eye. Once complete, he reveals the drawing. It is not a portrait as assumed, but rather a drawing of his thumb.

Mysteryâ€™s note:  
Take your time drawing. It makes for a grander build up and payoff.
