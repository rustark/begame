> Do you know why it’s called Red Bull?

> There was this Unicorn in the forest who was lost and wondered why she was the only one of her kind. So she set out on a quest to find other Unicorns like her.

> On the quest she ended up running into a magic fair and at this magic fair, there was a wizard. And the wizard told her, "The reason there are no unicorns left is because they were all chased to sea by a Red Bull.” So the wizard turned her into a beautiful woman to protect her from the Red Bull.

> The woman then ended up falling in love with a prince whose castle the Red Bull lived in. And she had a choice between being alone but in love or being a unicorn and being with the other unicorns for all eternity... She chose to be a Unicorn and got chased to sea by the Red Bull.

> So Red Bull is actually Unicorn piss.
