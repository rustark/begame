If you have a pen and paper or a bar napkin, sit down and write this out for them to see. It also works as a fantastic excuse to lock them in.

_Sit down or lock in_

> Everyone knows that girls mean time and money

**Write:** Girls = Time x money

> ... and as we all know, time is money

**Write:** Time = Money

> So therefore

**Write:** Girls = Money x Money = (Money)²

> And we also know that money is the root of all evil

**Write:** Money = √Evil

> So therefore

**Write:** Girls = (√Evil)²

> And thus

**Write:** Girls = Evil
