_Rubbing his belly with a content smile on his face_

> I’ve got a lobster... in my BELLY! There was this big tank, with a big-ass lobster. And I looked down into its beady little eyes and said, “I’m gonna eat you!” And I did. But now I feel bad. Not for eating him, he’s a part of me now. I love him. It’s because I didn’t eat all of him. It was surf and turf. I got filled up on steak. But you can’t doggie bag a lobster can you?! That would be downright UNCOUTH. 

> Do you know what my lobster is doing right now? _Belly rub._ It’s making LOVE in my BELLY!”

**Mystery’s note:** This is a Current Emotional State Opener, one that conveys your currently jovial state. You convey that you are non-needy, non-threatening, and in a playful emotional state with this opener. Accent on “in my belly” as when Mike Meyers in Austin Powers says in an Irish accent, “Get in ma belly!”
