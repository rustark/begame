WOMAN: Do you have a lighter?  
PUA: Well that depends. Do you want it to light a cigarette or light someone on fire?


Mysteryâ€™s note: If you are peacocking with a cool, interesting lighter (and you SHOULD be) she may make a favorable comment on it.

WOMAN: Oh, that so cool! Nice lighter! Let me see it! (etc).  
PUA: [Cocky & playful manner] You don't care about me, you're just interested in my lighter! How about I leave my lighter with you so that you two can get better acquainted?
