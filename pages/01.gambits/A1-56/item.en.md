> Did you know... That the TITANIC... Have you heard of it? It’s a ship... Did you know that the Titanic... Didn’t sink? And now you know. 

_Mimic a “mind blown” gesture with your hands to your head. Roll off even if the girls respond, then continue:_

> See, there were three ships: the Titanic, Olympic, and Britannic. The Olympic was the first built and the first to set sail across the ocean... And it was hit by another ship... In New York Harbor. After two weeks of repair, it limped back to South Hampton... Where I was last month... And guess what happened? This was a JP Morgan insurance scam. They switched ships... The reason why they only had half as many emergency boats... Is because they took half of them off. They didn’t want to sink them all. And they sank the Olympic. Now how do we know this? The grave site... The sunken ship... Two of the letters on the bow, where it says Titanic... They fell off... And they found underneath the letters M … P. OlyMPic. They found the Olympic.
