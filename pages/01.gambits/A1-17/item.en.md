> Hi. I'm from _bar/restaurant/parking garage_ quality control. I'd like to know if your experience with us has been AVERAGE, BETTER THAN AVERAGE, or CRAPPIER THAN AVERAGE?

At this point, most girls will play along and give you a funny little review of the place. This is ROLE PLAYING. Using the phrase "crappier than average" communicates to the women that this is just a fun little game, and that you're not
really from quality control.

**CONTINGENCIES:**

Girls:
> It's been crappier than average.

You:
> _Overdramatic_ GOD! I'm just trying to do my job here, you guys don't have to yell at me and hurt my feelings like that.

Girls:
> Average

You:
> _Quietly_ I know. This place sucks right? Listen I'm here from central and I'm about to fire everyone in this whole place. I might be able to offer you a position. Just give me a run down of your special talents first. You might be able to earn $7 an hour.

Girls:
> Better than average.

You: 
> Are you just saying that cause you're trying to get in my pants? Aww, that's so cute. We just met and you're like SOOO into me already... _get suddenly serious_ OK back off stalker.
