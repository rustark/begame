> What’s your first impression of black nails?

_Directly continuing onto the story_

> I was in an elevator and this shmarmy looking woman giving me the evil eye looks at my nails and says “Are you a devil worshipper?” Can you believe that? I said to er, “We’re going down, aren’t we.”

Mystery’s notes:  
This is a false opinion Opener. You don’t wait for a response when you show your black painted nails. You instead launch into voicing your opinion. Bring a nail polish bottle with you to the club. When you are in comfort with a girl, ask her to paint your nails, right there in the club. Other sets will see you look preselected, and you get your nails painted for free.
