> Wanna hear something fascinating? Enthusiasm... It turns out... Is actually ... CONTAGIOUS! How cool is THAT? I can talk about ... absolutely... NOTHING... and as long as they do it in an enthusiastic manner... You too will feel it. Isn't that CRAZZZY??? I feel it. Can you feel it? Isn't it INCREDIBLE?

_Then laugh it off to break tension._
