> Do you like seafood?

Girl:
> Huh/yes/no

> Ok check this out. When I was in 8th grade, there was this girl who would always bring weird seafood to school in a brown paper bag. It totally stunk up the whole cafeteria. She would sit there and eat squid and octopus. 

> It was so weird. We used to call her the weird seafood girl. And you look JUST LIKE HER.

> Well, I don't know if you're her or not, but just in case you are, I want to tell you I'm sorry, cause I used to be a big bully. This one time, I took your lunch when you werenâ€™t looking, and I dumped your squid salad into the aquarium in the science lab. I just had to admit it now that all these years have past. Can you ever forgive me?
