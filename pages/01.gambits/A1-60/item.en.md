> Hey, did you know that Elvis dyed... his hair? What was his natural hair color? Beach Boy BLOND. He must have thought black hair made him more bad-boy. What was his wifeâ€™s name? Pricilla? She died her hair too. Black. Can you picture the two of them, every two weeks, dying their hair, black ring in the sink, in some sick ceremonial ritual to appease their fans?! Ah the American Dream.

**Additional stuff:**
> Did you find Elvis hot? Would YOU be one of the chicks screaming at him? Young Elvis or OLD Elvis? Yeah, old Elvis was kinda scary. What singer do you find REALLY sexy today?
