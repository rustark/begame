PUA:  
> Watch!

The Pickup Artist pulls out a lighter and lights it. Focusing on the flame for a moment, he then pretends to take the fire with his other hand, throwing the flame invisibly through the air, watching the arch as the flame returns to the lighter, which he promptly lights. The flame has vanished, flown through the air, and returned.

PUA:   
> I know what you are thinking, miracle man!

Magicianâ€™s note: Proceed to then toss vanish the lighter, and reappear it in mid-air. This gambit will work without any sleight-of-hand.
