    'og:title': Mystery’s Girl’s Fighting Outside Opener

> OMG Did you guys see the fight outside? They will almost always say no, but occasionally there has really been an argument, so don’t be surprised if they say yes.

> Ok, so these two girls were fighting over this short little guy in a wife-beater, right? And it’s a messy fight – hair-pulling, punching, not pretty at all! And the bouncer is just standing there watching it with this stupid grin, so I shout at him “HEY! Do your job man!” So then he comes up and tries to restrain one of the girls. But now it's like a sort of one-sided fight cause the other girl just starts pounding on her. And then she grabs the girl's blouse and it rips and her boob pops out.

> Now, normally I'd be like "Well, welcome to _city name_" right? But this was like a saggy-baggy-boobie from National Geographic. It was pretty gross. So then I get talking to the guy in the wife-beater. He says his name is Jorge [pronounced like whore-hey], and I ask him to spell it. He says “Gee-ee-oh-ar-ge-ee”… That spells GEORGE. Those girls were fighting over a guy named George. That’s such a deal-breaker name! Like if your name was Beatrice, it just wouldn’t happen, I’m sorry!

**Alternative 1:**

> OMG Did you guys see the fight outside?

_They answer_

> Ok, so these two girls were fighting over this short little guy name George, right? And out of nowhere this guy comes up and tries to restrain one of the girls. But now it's like a sort of one-sided fight cause the other girl just starts pounding on her. And then she grabs the girl's blouse and it rips and her boob pops out.

_They: Woah!_

> Now, normally I'd be like "Well welcome to _city name_" right? But this was like a saggy-baggy-boobie from National Geographic. She was real embarrassed and took off that way.

**Alternative 2:**

> OMG, did you guys see that girl-fight outside?

_They answer_

> They were totally fighting over this funny guy. Have you guys ever fought over a guy?

_They answer_

> It was this short little guy named George, in a wife-beater... These girls were pulling each other's hair... One was pounding the other's head into the ground... One of her boobs popped out... Now, normally, I'm all for seeing boobs, but this was a gross, white-trash boob. Yuck. I mean, I'm a guy, and any straight guy that tells you he doesn't like seeing boobs is LYING. But this was just NASTY.

**Alternative 3:**

> OMG! Did you see those two girls fighting outside? Like right outside the club... They were totally going at it; one was pulling the other's hair, and the other one drew blood with her nails. Believe me, it was not a pretty sight. And they seemed to be fighting over this short guy; he was standing near them just totally laughing!
