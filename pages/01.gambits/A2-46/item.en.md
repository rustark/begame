_Take her hands and look at them._

> I was just looking at your hands because I'm a palm reader.

_Point to any line on her hand._

> This is your laugh line. You have a great sense of humor. But, sometimes you don't get the joke. Do your friends ever tell you “You are so blond!”

_Point to another line._

> This is your love line. I can tell from this that you make a great girlfriend. I can also tell that you are dating around a lot right now, you usually go out on 2 dates and then you lose interest. When you lose interest, sometimes you don’t have any idea why.

> You have very light/dark lines on your hands. If you have dark lines, it means you wear your heart on your sleeve. If you have light lines, it means you are the kind of person who hides your feelings.

_Point to another line._

> This is your life line. You are going to live to be 98. At around the age of 50 you are going to have a near death experience. You’re going to go into the tunnel, then you will see the light, then you will come back to life.

> In your 20's you are going to meet a guy that changes your life. Wait! I’m getting a vision! _Close your eyes like you’re having a psychic moment._

> You’re going to meet a guy who is... _describe yourself here like what you are wearing and look like_ and it’s a life changing experience.

> Wait I'm losing the vision. Aw sorry, I couldn’t tell who the guy was in my vision.

There’s no need to learn real palm reading. I do this same palm reading on every girl. It doesn’t matter what line on the hand you point to, or which hand you read.
