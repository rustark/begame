> Think of a number from one to four, don’t say it, just think that number written on a chalkboard in your head. Got it?

> Three.

> Think of a different number from one to ten, the first number that pops in your head, stick with it and draw it on the chalkboard in your mind. Have you done that?

> Seven.

**Magician’s note:** Most people pick 3 & 7 as their first picks. If you get them wrong say, “Proof that ESP is bullshit!”
