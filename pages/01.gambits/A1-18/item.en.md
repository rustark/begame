> Hey I have to ask you something, but first, promise you won’t get mad.

This builds the tension and suspense.


> Ok... I’m not sure how to ask you this, so I’m just gonna come right out with it, so don’t be mad at me. Did we have sex last week? 

_Don’t wait for an answer, just start talking faster and going into this next part._

> Because you look really familiar, and I was really drunk, and I’m pretty sure it was you, and I know I said I would call you, but I lost your number, cause I left my phone in a taxi... or something... and I just wanted to tell you that I know I’m jerk for not calling, but you were really good... and... your friend was really good too.

_Most girls will get the idea that this is a joke, but once in a while you will have to explain to them that you were just teasing them. Once in a while someone will take it too seriously._
