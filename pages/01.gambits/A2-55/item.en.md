    'og:title': Best Friends Test (Revised)
---

Interrupt your opener by stopping what you are saying and looking at them both as if you are curious about them:

> Wow, there is an interesting dynamic between you two! Ok, quick emotional connection test: do you guys like the same films?

_They should look at each other before answering. Interrupt their answer:_

> The answer doesn't matter. See I learned this at this conference of the mind I attended recently. When there is a strong emotional connection, people will always look at each other _use both hands to guide their gaze together again_ before they answer a question. Just like that!

> Ok, hand _take her hand_, now quick spin! _Spin her to lock in_ See, good friends have this psychic link so that in moments of increased emotional activity, they can look into each other’s eyes to balance their emotions.

### You can extend this with:

> You know what you guys should do for Christmas? You should each buy each other a shoulder-strap mirror _put your hand up by your shoulder, mimicking the face of a mirror_, that way if one of you isn’t around and you get asked a question, you can just… _Turn your head as if you look at yourself in the mirror on your shoulder..._ Use the mirror for the same effect.

**If only one or neither woman looks at the other before answering, say this instead:**

> The answer doesn't matter. See I learned this at this conference of the mind I attended recently. When there is a strong emotional connection, some people will always look at each other _use both hands to try to guide their gaze together again_ before they answer a question. Just like that! But other people, _point to the one or both that did not look at the other_ are very grounded emotionally, so they don’t need to balance themselves. Good for you! 

You can stack into the Girl Coding routine easily after this gambit.

[Alternative 1:](players/tyler-durden "Tyler Durden")

> You guys are best friends aren't you? You have exactly the same posture. And you have exactly the same facial expressions. And the big thing, and I don't know if all girls do this or what, but every time you go to talk, or I'm talking to you, or you're about to do something, you guys keep looking at each other first.

[Alternative 2:](players/style "Style")

> Okay, I have to ask, how long have you guys known each other for? If you think they're sisters, ask, “Are you guys sisters or best friends?”

**WOMEN:** <Sisters/Friends/Best friends>

> See, I knew that.

**WOMEN:** How could you know that?

> I'll show you. In fact, I'll give you the best friend test.

_They always get excited here - people love tests for some reason._

> Okay. _Pretend you’re about to ask a serious question._ Do you both use the same shampoo?

_Women look at each other, and then open their mouths to answer._

> Okay, the answer doesn't matter. You already passed.

**WOMEN:** ???

> See, if you weren't close to each other, you'd keep eye contact with me as you answered. But if two people have a connection, they look at each other first. Kind of like you're doing right now.

_Women giggle ( Style’s note: This is where the seduction newbies you just met see you making two strangers laugh and think you're a PUA God, LOL)._

> See, you don't even need to say anything to each other. It's like you just communicate telepathically.

[Notes:](players/style "Style") Then, there are a million places to go from here: often they'll just open up and start telling you about how they met. (Now you're REALLY in.)

If one looked at the other one first, then you say that she is submissive and the other is dominant in the friendship. (Can be a great neg.)

If they want more, I get personal here and ask, "Has one of you ever kissed someone the other person dated?" They fucking love this one - but don't make it your first question.

You can also use the telepathy line to launch into a mind-reading/cold-reading routine if you do that. You'll figure the rest of this out as you do it in the field. It fucking rocks.
