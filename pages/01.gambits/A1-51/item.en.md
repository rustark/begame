> Hey guys, would you ever get a tattoo? The reason I ask is, my nineteen-year-old sister / niece wants to get her boyfriend’s name tattooed on her shoulder.

**GROUP:** No, don't let her do it.

> See, that’s the problem. She's really strong headed and when I tell her not to get the tattoo it just makes her want to get it even more. How do I deal with that and let her really know it’s a mistake?

### Alternative:

> Hey guys, on a scale of 1 to 10 ... What do you think of tattoos on girls?

_The women talk for a bit, probably one of them has a tattoo, then you interrupt:_

> Get this! My little sister has been with this guy for maybe 2 months, she's 19 years old, and she wants to get his NAME tattooed right here on her ARM. What do you guys think about that?

_Allow the group to talk for a bit, then interrupt:_

> My problem is, I'm her big brother, and if I tell her not to do it, she'll just want to do it MORE. Would you guys listen to your big brother if he warned you about something like that?
