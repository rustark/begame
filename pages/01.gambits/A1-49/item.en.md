> Hey guys, this is very important, and we need your perspective. It's a matter of life and death. My friend and I were having a debate and your answer could completely change our entire lives, ready?

> Do you brush your teeth before or after you floss?

Point to each in the group as you say “Before or after?” Get each person’s yes or no answer. Finally…

> See, nobody knows!

### Part 2

> Ok so I've been having this fight with a girlfriend of mine. She says you should brush before you floss. I say after. We even asked our own dentists, and our dentists told us the same!

_You can neg your target by saying the answer is the opposite of what she said_

> Wow interesting... You have a U-shaped smile. [Stack into the C vs U smile gambit.]
