The PUA takes his ring and puts it in the middle of his left hand.

> I’m going to make this ring... Vanish from my left hand... And reappear in my right hand. 

He closes his left hand, then his right.

> Ready? On the count of three. One, two, three, now. And the ring is now in my right hand.

The PUA stares at his closed right hand, but does not open his hands (which is funny).

> Now for the hard part... To bring it back. Three, two, one, now. 

He looks back to his left hand and opens it, revealing the ring.

> I know. Miracle.

Magician’s note: Follow up by toss vanishing the ring, show both hands empty, then
reappear from mid-air. This gambit works without sleight-of-hand however. It gets a
laugh.
