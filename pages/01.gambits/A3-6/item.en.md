> Here... twirl for me _twirl her_ You’re cute and you can dance. Awesome, you’re my new girlfriend... Wait a minute... What did you say your name was?  That’s what I thought you said, I KNEW this was too good to be true. I can’t even talk to you now.

Girl:
> Why??

> My ex’s name was (-----------) but she was really rich. (Act excited that she may be rich.) Are you rich?

_wait for answer_

> No? Hmmmm…. It’s a good thing my boy-band is about to explode. Don’t worry sweetie. We’ll be ok…. I’ll provide for us….. I’ll put food on the table. We’re gonna make a great couple. It’ll be really fun. We’ll join Netflix and order in cheap Chinese.

### If she doesn’t twirl

> You won’t twirl for me?

Her:
> No

> Sweetie... That Square-dancing contest is in three days! How are we ever gonna take first if we don’t practice? We all know how bratty you can get if you don’t win.
