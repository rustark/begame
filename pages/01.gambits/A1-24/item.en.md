> Hey how many pairs of shoes do you have? 

> I use to know this girl at work, she had hundreds of pairs of shoes and would bring a bag full of shoes to work every day. She would come into the lunchroom in the glass stripper heels and sit down next to me and say _slow and sexy_ “What’s in your sandwich today, cutie?” All my co-workers would make fun of me because the sexy shoe girl had a crush on me. 

> You look just like her. I can’t tell if you’re really her, but just in case you are, I wanted to say I’m really sorry we never went on a date. I know I promised I would call you......but.... I...I....I.....lost your number.....and my car broke down....and I forgot....and um....my dog ate your number. Really sorry.
