> Can you cook?

Girl: yes/no.

> Ok, Can you clean?

> Wait, are you rich?

> Heres the thing, I’m looking for a Sugar Mama. I need a girl to take me shopping, buy me new clothes and once get to know each other better then I want a new car and a new home.

Contingencies:

This routine can also works in a groups. I just say, “Who’s the Richest? I’m looking for a Sugar Mama.” The girls will point at the friend with the most money so I kino her and tease her. 

Then I say, “Great we need someone that can cook, who’s the best cook? We also need someone that can clean, who wants to clean? We also need a Driver, who’s the best driver?”

The girls will also say a lot of time that they are looking for a Suger Daddy.
Then I run my Grandpa Routine.
