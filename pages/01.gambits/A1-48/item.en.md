### Short Version

**PUA:** Hey guys ... Do you think spells work? I have a friend who met a girl... Women, you’re all evil... And she cast a love spell on him. And now he’s in love with her! Like, love love. Is this the power of the spell or is it all psychological?

### Embellished Version

**MYSTERY:** Hey guys ... Do you think spells work?  
**MYSTERY:** Our friend, he's not out with us tonight, because he's with this girl...  
**MYSTERY:** We met her at a party last weekend and she said she's a witch. So... They ended up going home together, and made out, but nothing more happened and he passed out on the couch. He said she wasn't really his type after all.  
**MYSTERY:** When he woke up, he found this tiny scroll of parchment tied with a leather string with a feather stuck in it. There were weird markings inside.  
**MYSTERY:** So we happened to be down at this esoteric shop the next day, cause I like to get candles, and we asked the proprietor what he thinks of this little scroll. You know, this is one of those guys with tattoos all over his face and stuff.  
**MYSTERY:** So he says: "Oh, that's a love spell." The strangest thing is, ever since then, I never see my friend anymore. He's always hanging out with this girl, twenty-four seven. He says he's in love with her. So do you think it's magic or just psychology?

### ALternative

**PUA:** Hey guys, help us settle something here. Do you think spells work?

[Let them contribute as much as they will, then FTC and continue into backstory]

**MYSTERY:** The reason I'm asking is because my friend over there met a girl at a club last week. She wasn't really his type, but he was kinda drunk and they ended up going back to his place. Well... After she left, he found a leather scroll and some feathers under his couch. Well, he took it to a magic store and they said it was an attraction spell. And now the strange thing is, he can't stop thinking of her. Do you think it's magic, or just psychology?
