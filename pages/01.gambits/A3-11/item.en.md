If a woman has an interesting piercing ...

> Hey, do you get people asking if that hurt? I used to get it all the time with my lip ring. I'd get asked like 10 times a day! It's a lip piercing, of course it hurt! Here, lemme ram a piece of steel through your lip and we'll see if you feel pain.

> My ex was worse, she had two rows of rings down her back and ran some lace through them so her back looked like a corset. She was like a gothic model, so that sort of thing was perfectly normal. But the cool part was that you could actually pull the lace and tighten up her abdomen!
